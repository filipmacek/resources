Macros are a really powerful tool in your Rust toolkit, and you get many benefits if you know how to use them properly.
For example, you can generate multiple constant values in struct with macro.
The good thing about struct constants is they are easy to create and they come with all the related struct methods and implemented traits.\
I got an idea for this article when I was looking at code of `http` Rust library [here](https://github.com/hyperium/http/blob/master/src/status.rs).

## Intro

Let's model HTTP status code in Rust. We know that each status code has a corresponding integer number and string title.
It's easier to remember it by title because it will tell us more than just the raw number. And creating them with constants is easy and intuitive.

```rust
let ok = StatusCode::OK
let accepted = StatusCode:: ACCEPTED
let server_error = StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
```

## Solution

We can model HTTP status code with a tuple struct type that only contains one integer value, `u16` as code number.
We then create some standard methods and constructor with `new` method.\
To create constant value just write `pub const` inside `impl` block for struct and put string for each status code inside `title` method.

```rust
pub struct StatusCode(u16);

impl StatusCode{
    pub const OK:StatusCode = StatusCode(200);
    pub const CREATED:StatusCode = StatusCode(201);
    pub const INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR:StatusCode = StatusCode(500);
    /// ...others

    pub fn new(num:u16)->Self{ Self(num) }

    pub fn number(&self)->u16{ self.0 }

    pub fn title(&self)->Option<&'static str>{
        match self.0 {
            200 => Some("OK"),
            201 => Some("Created"),
            500 => Some("Internal Server Error"),
            _ => None
        }
    }
}
```

And if you need to print status code, you implement `Display` trait which will use `self.title` method.

```rust
impl Display for StatusCode{
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(f,"{} {}",self.0,self.title().unwrap_or("<unknown status code>"))
    }
}
```

This is the normal way of creating const variables inside structs. But there are few concerns that I have about this way compared to macro method
which we will show bellow.

- there are over 63 status code so impl block will be long and filled with const value
- writing repeating syntax for every new constant
- implementations and methods are closely coupled with constant instances of struct type

Better and more clear approach would be to move instance creation outside this `impl` block and
leave only methods for clear and concise view what functionality this type has.

```rust
pub struct StatusCode(u16);

impl StatusCode{
    pub fn new(num:u16)->Self { Self(num) }

    pub fn number(&self)->u16 { self.0 }

    pub fn title(&self)->Option<&'static str> {
        all_titles(self.0)
    }
}
```

## Macros to rescue

What are macros in general? It a way of writing code that writes other code, which is known as _metaprogramming_.
Idea behind macro is basically to produce more code with less code, if that makes sense :D .
There are a lot of similarities between macros and functions. However, macros have some additional powers that functions don't and there are some differences.

- in function signature you must type all the input params, but macros can take variable number of params
- you can define and call functions anywhere, but macros need to be defined or brought into scope before you call them
- macros definition are generally more difficult to read, understand, and maintain
- macros are expanded before the compiler interprets the meaning of the code

We create macros with `marcro_rules!` keyword. Then we use a set of parentheses to encompass the whole pattern.
Dollar sign `$` is used as macro variable identifier to be distinguished from a  regular Rust variable.\
Patterns `$(...)*` and `$(...)+` specifies that the pattern matches zero/one or more times `...` expression.

We will use macro for two things. One is to generate const value and other is for creating `all_titles` function where
we typed all the status codes and its corresponding title.


When starting to work on macros, it's always a good idea to first visualize how would you call this macro, and then start implementing it.

```rust
status_codes! {
    (200,OK,"OK");
    (201, CREATED, "Created");
    (500, INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, "Internal Server Error");
}
```

So the next thing is to figure out how to type expression `(200,OK,'OK');` inside macro.
Macro variables are represented like this `$NAME:TYPE` where `NAME` is the name of variable that we will use in macro block,
and `TYPE` is fragment specifier which matches Rust syntax to this variable. We will need `expr` and `ident` specifiers. The results is:

```
  ($number:expr,$konst:ident,$phrase:expr);
```

We then surround it with `$(...)+` to indicate that our macro will accept multiple value that matches our predefined pattern.
Next is to define `impl` block for our `StatusCode` struct where we will put all the status codes as constant value.

```rust
impl StatusCode{
    $( pub const $konst:StatusCode = StatusCode($number); )+
}
```

As you see pattern `$(...)+` is also used for code multiplication.
And at the end we define our function `all_titles` where all `phrases` are typed.


```rust
fn all_titles(code:u16)->Option<&'static str>{
    match code {
        $ ( $number => Some($phrase), )+
        _ => None
    }
}
```

And that's it. Full macro code is now:

```rust
macro_rules! status_codes{
    (
        $(
            ($number:expr,$konst:ident,$phrase:expr);
        )+
    )=>{
        impl StatusCode{
            $( pub const $konst:StatusCode = StatusCode($number); )+
        }

        fn all_titles(code:u16)->Option<&'static str>{
            match code {
                $ ( $number => Some($phrase), )+
                _ => None
            }
        }

    }
}
```

With this macro you just type status code,titles and constant variable names and all constant values are generated.
