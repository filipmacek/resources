Everytime I needed to use throttling for some function I used [throttle-debounce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/throttle-debounce) package.
Its battle tested library and always working, so if you need that functionality you can use it.
But today, let's create our own with the pure Typescript to actually see what is happening under the hood.


## Definition

First lets define term **throttling** . To throttle a _function means executing it only once in specific time interval_.
This means throttling will prevent function from running multiple times when called by some other process.
You need this functionality very often in data and UI intensive application.


## Implementation

Most important thing is to understand how `setTimeout` is behaving. It sets a timer which executes a function after specified
delay. As function executing requests are coming, we are dropping all other requests and only remembering the last. This is the function
that will eventually be executed after time interval passes. Algorithm looks like this:

1. If we didn't run function before, run it now and remember the timestamp
2. This timestamp will mark the beginning of next interval with duration of `limit`
3. As new requests for function execution come, drop the current one with `clearTimeout`
and set this function as our current running function.
4. Wrap our target function with one which check if `limit` time has passed after last execution.
5. Scheduled execution at the end of this interval

```typescript
export const throttle = (func:any,limit:number) => {
  let lastFunc:any;
  let lastRanTimestamp:number;
  return function (...args) {
    if (!lastRanTimestamp){
      func(args)
      lastRanTimestamp = Date.now()
    }else{
      // Clear the last func
      if (lastFunc){
        clearTimeout(lastFunc)
      }
      // Set this function as our current running function
      // but with a timer
      lastFunc = setTimeout(()=>{
        if(Date.now() - lastRanTimestamp >= limit){
          func(args)
          lastRanTimestamp = Date.now()
        }
      },limit - (Date.now()-lastRanTimestamp))
    }
  }
}


```
